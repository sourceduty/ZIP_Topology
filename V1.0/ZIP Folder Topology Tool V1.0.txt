ZIP Folder Topology Tool was developed to visualize the structure of files and folders within a .zip archive. By reading the contents of a .zip file, it generates a topological diagram that displays the hierarchical relationships between directories and files. The user interface, built using Python's tkinter library, is both functional and visually appealing, allowing users to easily navigate, view, and save the generated topology. The program efficiently parses the archive, skipping over unnecessary directory entries, and focusing on creating a clear, concise representation of the file structure.

One of the standout features of this program is its ability to present the entire directory structure in a single, cohesive line that reflects the title of the .zip archive. This approach minimizes clutter and makes it easier for users to understand the overall structure at a glance. The program also effectively manages nested directories by creating indentation levels that visually represent the hierarchy, ensuring that each file and subfolder is placed in its correct position under the appropriate directory header.

The program has been optimized to enhance performance and user experience. It avoids redundant calculations and unnecessary string operations, making the process of generating the topology both faster and more efficient. Additionally, the user interface is designed to be dynamic, with the text area expanding or contracting based on the window size. This ensures that the program remains easy to use across different screen sizes, providing a flexible and user-friendly experience.

Aesthetically, the program adopts a dark theme, with a black background and yellow text, which not only gives it a modern look but also improves readability by providing a high contrast. This color scheme extends across all elements of the user interface, including buttons and text fields, creating a cohesive and visually appealing design. By combining functionality with an intuitive and attractive interface, this program offers a practical tool for anyone who needs to explore the contents of .zip files quickly and efficiently.
